## About FADE
FADE is a flexible format for longform improv that allows for more improvisation and experimentation. There is no set structure, but the scenes typically revolve around a central theme or concept.

The FADE format was created by Del Close in the 1980s. Close was a pioneer in the field of longform improv, and he developed the FADE format as a way to create more open-ended and improvisational shows.

The FADE format is typically used for shows that are 30-60 minutes long. The show begins with a group scene, which introduces the central theme or concept. The improvisers then create a series of scenes that explore this theme or concept in more detail. The scenes can be of any length or style, and there is no need to follow a linear storyline.

The FADE format is a good choice for groups that want to experiment with different improv techniques and create unique and memorable shows. It is also a good choice for groups that have a strong ensemble cast, as it allows each improviser to shine.
