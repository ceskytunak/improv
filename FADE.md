# FADE improv longform

FADE is a flexible format for longform improv that allows for more improvisation and experimentation. There is no set structure, but the scenes typically revolve around a central theme or concept.

The FADE format was created by Del Close in the 1980s. Close was a pioneer in the field of longform improv, and he developed the FADE format as a way to create more open-ended and improvisational shows.

The FADE format is typically used for shows that are 30-60 minutes long. The show begins with a group scene, which introduces the central theme or concept. The improvisers then create a series of scenes that explore this theme or concept in more detail. The scenes can be of any length or style, and there is no need to follow a linear storyline.

The FADE format is a good choice for groups that want to experiment with different improv techniques and create unique and memorable shows. It is also a good choice for groups that have a strong ensemble cast, as it allows each improviser to shine.

Here are some of the benefits of using the FADE format:

-   More flexibility: The FADE format is more flexible than other longform formats, such as the Harold. This allows improvisers to be more creative and take more risks.
-   More improvisation: The FADE format allows for more improvisation than other longform formats. This can lead to more exciting and unpredictable shows.
-   More exploration: The FADE format allows improvisers to explore themes and concepts in more depth than other longform formats. This can lead to more meaningful and insightful shows.
